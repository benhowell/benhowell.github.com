	  I'm a software engineer from Hobart, Tasmania and when not working, I spend time mountain biking and tinkering in my workshop. I've worked in many different domains with numerous programming paradigms and languages.

	  <p>
	    Most recently, I have been working in electroencephalography and eye-tracking, sensor informatics and message-oriented middleware. My first foray into programming was with BASIC on the Commodore64 and BBC Micro A/B in the mid 80's.

	    My current position is as Senior Software Engineer at the CSIRO, Autonomous Systems Laboratory but this blog, its content and opinions are entirely my own. They do not reflect the opinions of my employer.
