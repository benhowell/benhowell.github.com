	  I'm a software engineer from Hobart, Tasmania and when not working, I spend time mountain biking, bush walking, gardening, travelling and tinkering in my workshop.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I began my programming adventures in the mid 1980's with BASIC on the Commodore64 and BBC Micro (mostly writing and extending text based adventure games). Since then, I have worked in many domains across a variety of platforms with numerous programming languages.

	  <p>
	    I have held a variety of positions over the years, including system/network administrator, software developer, independent contractor, systems analyst, and research team leader.
