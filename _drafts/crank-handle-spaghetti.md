I think our industry is in a state where 98% of the code produced is just junk: unmaintainable, barely working, no future, career-killing garbage just waiting to fail at the worst time. This is tolerated because software victories are worth (or, at least, valued at) gigantic sums of money: billions of dollars in some cases.
I'm not sure how well we can "afford" it. Do we want to go through another 2000-3? How much use is it to have massive numbers of people writing low-quality code, not because they're incapable but because they're managed specifically to produce shit code quickly in order to meet capriciously changing and often nonsensical "requirements" at high speed? I think it's great for building scam businesses that demo well and then fail horribly when code-quality issues finally become macroscopic business problems and eventually lead to investors losing faith. (Oh, and those failures are all going to happen around the same time.) I'm not sure that it's good for society to produce code this way. So much of the code out there is "totaled": it would cost more to fix or maintain it than to rewrite it from scratch. You can't (or shouldn't) build anything on that.




I do not think it's because most programmers just aren't trying hard enough, or don't know that it's junk. I think it's because most places paying programmers do not give them enough time to produce quality (both in terms of time spent coding and time spent developing their skills). And if say 98% of code produced is junk, and it's because not enough programmer time was spent on them... that's a lot of extra programmer time needed, which is a lot of expense.
The utopian theory of the OP is that with the right tooling, it would not take any more time, or would even take less time, to develop quality software. I think it's a pipe dream.


As long as the job of a programmer is to be a business subordinate, it will not change and we'll see crappy code forever.
Mainstream business culture conceives of management as a greater-than relationship. You're a lesser being than your boss, who's a lesser being than his boss, and so on... It also is inhospitable to the sorts of people who are best at technology itself. Finally and related, it conceives of "working for" someone not as (a) working toward that person's benefit, as in a true profession, but (b) being on-call to be micromanaged. The result is that most programmers end up overmanaged, pigeonholed, disempowered, and disengaged. Shitty code results.
If you want to fix code, you have to fix the work environment for programmers. Open allocation is a big step in the right direction, and technical decisions should be made by technical people. Ultimately, we have to stop thinking of "working for" someone as subordination and, instead, as working toward that person's benefit. Otherwise, of course we're going to get shitty code as people desperately scramble (a) up the ladder, or (b) into a comfortable hiding place.




One particular point of developer inequality and technical debt that I see get ignored is people with the social credit or track that lets them only create new things as opposed to those that have to do maintenance.
I find the latter often appreciate the place and purpose of types more clearly than the former, even if the former would benefit as well from having concise encodings of intent in the design and creation phase.
This bias is prevalent in dyn-lang/consulting-oriented communities, often because they are churning out projects and dumping them on their clients/employers.

To bolster this argument. I made my consulting money off coming in to fix projects that had been churned out like this. The issue is real enough to warrant good money to fix.

To be fair, businessmen are short-tempered and flightly. They're like 15-year-olds who love one band one week and hate it the next. You have to make impressions-- flashy ones-- quickly because they have no ability to judge code quality, and can only tell who seems to be working fast.
In this light, isn't the "get it out quickly" strategy (maintenance be damned) exactly what they've asked for? In an industry where programmers are business subordinates, not true professionals, should anything else be done?
I am playing devil's advocate insofar as I agree with you. (I also think creators worth their salt want to see their work through, which means they're already doing "maintenance" work by the time they're finished.) However, I don't see how anything else can become the norm, given that The Business sees us as a cost center and a commodity.




The proliferation of shitty Javascript is crushing the web. J
Javascript is designed from the ground up to enable bad developers to write shitty code. It's fine for alpha work, terrible for production.
It is possible to write beautiful, elegant, maintainable Javascript- but I've never seen a "designer" or even a "JavaScript programmer" write code like that. I have a job as a code mechanic because so many companies are built on woeful Javascript.
