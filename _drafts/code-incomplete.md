**Humility**
</span>

/hjʊˈmɪlɪti/

<p>
<span markdown="span">_The quality of having a modest or low view of one’s importance._</span>
</p>

<p>
Humility is the single character trait above all others, that will ensure you evolve as a programmer (or developer, engineer, title du jour). It is this trait that separates the lifers, the entrenched and the dunning-krugers from the evolving, craft honing programmer you should be. 
</p>

<p>
To admit you have a lot to learn, to admit mistakes, to admit you design pretty crappy systems sometimes, to admit that your way, the "best practice" way, the evangelists way is just <span markdown="span">_one_</span> way, and sometimes may well be the wrong way, is not a weakness. It is not the sign of an amatuer. It is a measure of professionalism. Humility is a strength, and it is this strength that will drive your evolution as a programmer to greater things.

#### Review your previous work. You're guaranteed to be your harshest critic.
A cathartic and essential exercise for any programmer is to revisit your old code. Do it regularly. Doesn't matter the language or project, just choose some old code and start reading it. Understand it. Sometimes you find a rare gem of elegant code and think to yourself "that's a great solution I crafted there", however, these occurences are the exception to the rule. If you aren't cringing, scratching or shaking your head, if you aren't thinking to yourself "That's crap, present me could've done so much better" then you can retire now. You're done as a programmer.

#### Revel in your bug reports, complaints and criticisms. You aren't your code.
You should encourage anyone and everyone to do their best to break your software. Testers, colleagues, users. Actively promote criticism of your works. Today, we live in a society where people don't like hurting others feelings, and at the same time, some programmers take criticism of their work as a personal attack.


and some even go so far as to defend to the point of senility their buggy piece of crap. Don't be one of these. Don't take it personally. Revel in bug reports, congratulate the person who keeps breaking great holes in your software as it is these people making your product great.

#### There is no one language, design pattern or methodology to rule them all. This isn't Lord of the Rings.
Studying different languages, applying different design patterns and following different methodologies along the way will allow you to view things from multiple angles and allow you to be critical of past and present solutions in your repertoire. Your go to language and patterns today are just a [blub paradox][1].

According to Larry Wall(1), the original author of the Perl programming language, there are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris

Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.
Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.
Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about.

Bad developers, who constitute the majority of all developers worldwide, can write bad code in any language you throw at them.



You just have to be careful, because as with any other language, you can easily find people who know a lot about the language environment, and very little about taste, computing, or anything else that's important.

When in doubt, hire Java programmers who are polyglots, who detest large spongy frameworks like J2EE and EJB, and who use Emacs. All good rules of thumb.



Go ahead, form opinions, debate, design, theorise, hypothesise, test yours, and others ideas with conviction, but always be ready to be wrong and try a different approach. And by all means, break the rules and try something against advice, but whatever you do, don't become a zealot.




Beware the programmer who already knows the solution to everything.

Master craftsmanship is rarely ever reached by even the most seasoned programmer. The title "expert", should be considered a moving target that, even though we do our best to attain it, always stays just out of our reach.

Be a life long student. Be humble. Invite critisism.
