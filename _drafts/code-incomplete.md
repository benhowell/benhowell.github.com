**Humility**
</span>

/hjʊˈmɪlɪti/

<p>
<span markdown="span">_The quality of having a modest or low view of one’s importance._</span>
</p>

<p>
Humility is the single character trait above all others, that will ensure you evolve as a programmer (or developer, engineer, title du jour). It is this trait that separates the lifers, the entrenched and the dunning-krugers from the evolving, craft honing programmer you should be. 
</p>

<p>
To admit you have a lot to learn, to admit mistakes, to admit you design pretty crappy systems sometimes, to admit that your way, the "right way", the "best practice" way, the evangelists way is just <span markdown="span">_one_</span> way, and may well be the wrong way, is not a weakness. It is not the sign of an amatuer. It is indeed a strength, and it is this strength that will drive your evolution as a programmer to greater things. Go ahead, form opinions, debate, defend with reason, but always be ready to be wrong and try a different approach. Alternatively, break the rules and try something against advice, but whatever you do, don't become a zealot.

A cathartic and essential exercise for any programmer is to revisit some of their old code. Do it regularly. Doesn't matter the language or project, just choose some old code and start reading it. Understand it. Sometimes you find a rare gem of elegant code and think to yourself "that's a great solution I crafted there", however, these occurences are the exception to the rule. If you aren't cringing, scratching or shaking your head, if you aren't thinking to yourself "That sucks, present me could've done so much better" then you can retire now. You're done as a programmer.

#### There is no single language, design pattern or methodology. This isn't Lord of the Rings.
Studying different languages, applying different design patterns and following different methodologies along the way will allow you to view things from multiple angles and allow you to be critical of past and present solutions in your repertoire. Your go to language and patterns today are just a [blub paradox][1].

#### Revel in your bug reports, complaints and feature requests.

Bad developers, who constitute the majority of all developers worldwide, can write bad code in any language you throw at them.



You just have to be careful, because as with any other language, you can easily find people who know a lot about the language environment, and very little about taste, computing, or anything else that's important.

When in doubt, hire Java programmers who are polyglots, who detest large spongy frameworks like J2EE and EJB, and who use Emacs. All good rules of thumb.








Beware the programmer who already knows the solution to everything.

Master craftsmanship is rarely ever reached by even the most seasoned programmer. The title "expert", should be considered a moving target that, even though we do our best to attain it, always stays just out of our reach.

Be a life long student. Be humble. Invite critisism.
