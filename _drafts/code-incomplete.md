**Humility**
</span>

/hjʊˈmɪlɪti/

<p>
<span markdown="span">_The quality of having a modest or low view of one’s importance._</span>
</p>

<p>
Humility is the single character trait above all others, that will ensure you evolve as a programmer (or developer, engineer, title du jour). It is this trait that separates the lifers, the entrenched and the dunning-krugers from the evolving, craft honing programmer you should be. 
</p>

<p>
To admit you have a lot to learn, to admit mistakes, to admit you design pretty crappy systems sometimes, to admit that your way, the "right way", the "best practice" way, the evangelists way is just <span markdown="span">_one_</span> way, and may well be the wrong way, is not a weakness. It is not the sign of an amatuer. It is indeed a strength, and it is this strength that will drive your evolution as a programmer to greater things. Go ahead, form opinions, debate, defend with reason, but always be ready to be wrong and try a different approach. Whatever you do, don't become a zealot.

A cathartic and essential exercise for any programmer is to revisit old code. Doesn't matter the language or project, just choose some old code and start reading it. Understand it. Sometimes you find a rare gem of elegant code and think to yourself "that's a good solution", however, these occurences are the exception to the rule. If you aren't cringing, scratching or shaking your head, if you aren't thinking to yourself "I could write that so much better" then you can retire now. You're done as a programmer.





revisit old code. see how bad it is, wonder why you didn't use a more appropriate pattern, not understand why you use such strange data structures, wonder why it is so clunky, non functional, etc.

studying different langs along the way will make you see things in a different light


When I started at Amazon, I could recite for you all the incantations, psalms, voodoo chants and so on that I'd learned, all in lieu of intelligence or experience, the ones that told me Multiple Inheritance is Evil 'cuz Everyone Says So, and Operator Overloading Is Evil, and so on. I even vaguely sort of knew why, but not really. Since then I've come to realize that it's not MI that sucks, it's developers who suck. I sucked, and I still do, although hopefully less every year.

Bad developers, who constitute the majority of all developers worldwide, can write bad code in any language you throw at them.

That said, though, MI is no picnic; mixins seem to be a better solution, but nobody has solved the problem perfectly yet. But I'll still take Java over C++, even without MI, because I know that no matter how good my intentions are, I will at some point be surrounded by people who don't know how to code, and they will do far less damage with Java than with C++.

Besides, there's way more to Java than the core language. And even the language is evolving, albeit glacially, so there's hope. It's what we should be using at Amazon.

You just have to be careful, because as with any other language, you can easily find people who know a lot about the language environment, and very little about taste, computing, or anything else that's important.

When in doubt, hire Java programmers who are polyglots, who detest large spongy frameworks like J2EE and EJB, and who use Emacs. All good rules of thumb.




Master craftsmanship is rarely ever reached by even the most seasoned programmer. The title "expert", should be considered a moving target that, even though we do our best to attain it, always stays just out of our reach.

Be a life long student. Be humble. Invite critisism.
