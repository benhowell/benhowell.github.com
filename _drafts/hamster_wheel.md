 The Developer's Dystopian Future
I was always a worrier, but I used to be a young worrier. Now I am not so young. I still find things to worry about.

I find myself more and more concerned about my future as a developer.

As I’ve gotten older, I don’t stay up so late anymore. I spend more time with my family than on the computer (despite what they may say). I help in my community on a local school board, and I organize events for an open source interest group I started.

I think about how I used to fill my time with coding. So much coding. I was willing to dive so deep into a library or framework or technology to learn it.

My tolerance for learning curves grows smaller every day. New technologies, once exciting for the sake of newness, now seem like hassles. I’m less and less tolerant of hokey marketing filled with superlatives. I value stability and clarity.

I used to be really excited about JavaScript. I worked for five years running an open source project that was 95% JavaScript. I still never felt like I had a great handle on the tech stack though, and my understanding of so much of the new JS hotness (ES6, Angular, Ember, Shadow DOM, Module systems, etc) feels woefully lightweight. So many jobs seem to ask for AngularJS knowledge now. I took a few stabs at it, but the frequent BC breaks and plans for 2.0 have almost entirely soured me on the framework. My interest in rich client-side apps has almost entirely reversed, and now I’m more interested in doing good ol’ server rendering with the occasional side of progressive enhancement, just like we did it in 2004.

At my day job we primarily use Python for our server side stack. I like the language, but I still feel like I don’t really know what I’m doing with it. I have 15 years of PHP under my belt, so I often know what I want to do, but not how to make it happen in Python. I don’t feel like I really grok the module system. I definitely don’t understand the class system. What the hell is a generator and how does it work the way it does? I am so lost.

Don’t even get me started on DevOps. Have you ever tried setting up something on AWS? There are a billion buttons and settings and new, invented words I don’t understand. I have no clue how any of that stuff works.

All of these problems would be solvable, given time and motivation. But motivation determines how I use my time, and I am just not terribly motivated to use what spare time I have to change the situation. There are other, more important needs in my life that are not related to programming languages.

What I’m most scared of, though, is being left behind.

Did you know I used to be a “designer?” Seriously. In 1999 my skills were decent enough to be called that on the web. I used to design CD art for an indie record label. Somewhere around 2005 or so, what passed for Good Design on the web flew right by my skills. I stopped putting “designer” in my bio a couple years ago, because it was ridiculous.

It was a bit easier when I was a one man web shop, which I was for many years. I configured my own Apache, PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and the like. I wrote my own server side code. I wrote my own HTML, and CSS, and JavaScript. I got to touch all of it, and I liked it a lot.

Things change when you’re part of a team. It makes tons of sense, but I do miss it. I miss being able to play at design and HTML and CSS and see it into production. I miss being able to tweak server configs to see if I could squeeze extra performance out of PostgreSQL. Now I feel terribly specialized, and there doesn’t seem like much point to exploring those things if I’m not going to actually use it in my day job — especially when there are few other opportunities to do anything with the tech.

I’m scared that either the job “web developer” is outpacing me, or my skills are atrophying.

Where will I be in 10 years? I don’t know. I hope I still will have some in-demand skills to pay the bills. But it feels like all I see are DevOps and JavaScript, and I know less and less every day about those things.

I hope I still have something to offer. I don’t know what it will be, though.

Relax. A lot of those technologies will be dead. And you should be intimidated by angular and ember. They have the smell of Enterprise Java for me.
Learn paradigms and principles. If you know what to do, you will be able to find the tools to do it.
Its a bit like cooking - the cookbooks for the peasants give recipes. The ones for the chefs give mechanics and techniques.
So learn pointers, functional programming, asynchronous operations and few more important paradigms, learn how to keep a code base tidy and organized and just ignore the foam on the water that is the hot new tech. You will be able to learn it in a week when need arises.

Here's good news from present me: as you gain more experience, (which can correlate to the older you get, especially when you start early), you get better at knowing when something will really improve your work (making it faster, better looking, more enjoyable, better performing, more efficient, etc.) and when it won't. Perhaps the article's author is actually on to something. He intuitively knows New Tool X won't improve his work much, and he's wiser than his younger self, who would waste time chasing non-essential niceties.

You've got plenty of time. Other commenters are right, focus on theory, and bolster that by building things. Constantly. If there's one lesson I could hope to impart to any budding developer, it's to never stop building. Learn a bit about genetic algorithms - then implement a simple one. Learn a little Ruby, then build something with it. This will teach you a lot of what you need to know - fill in the gaps with Google. Focus on building good abstractions, and you'll be fine wherever you go.

I relate to this quite strongly. Whether you like it or not, a software career forces you into being a generalist eventually. Technology changes dramatically every few years - unable to improve what we have, we do entire revolutions to make incremental progress, and in the process, we make everybody's skills stale. The only things that survive are the principles that are common to everything. There's nothing you can do about that. And once you end up a generalist it is very hard to be appreciated for your wide breadth of general skills. People want the best person for exactly the job they are about to do, very few take a long view, very few even have the luxury to do that.
From another perspective, we are in unknown territory here. Us 40+ developers are at the vanguard of a generation of software people who have no trail blazed before them to tell us where our careers should go. There simply isn't a widespread professional software industry of 50+ and 60+ years old for us to look at and say "that will be me in 10 years". We were largely the first generation for whom software was a major industry. I take comfort from this because in all likelihood it will work out better than our worst fears would have us imagine. It is as much the lack of example and uncertainty as the reality that makes us feel insecure.





Unless for need, interest or fun, do not learn like-for-like frameworks and languages in a vain effort to keep up. Instead learn to abstract and/or generalise the relevent benefits and technologies behind the latest hipster framework and only learn what languages and frameworks _you_ want to learn. Another new MVC framework? Learn MVC instead.


#### Asleep at the Wheel
Learn theory and technique, gain a deeper and fundamental knowledge. Get off the hamster wheel.
