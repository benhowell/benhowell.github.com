Whether you're selling physical goods, information or software products, or consulting services, the only thing that matters to your customers is the fact that you can fix <i>their</i> problem. Your customers are selfish. They only care about themselves. 
</p>
<p>
Why is it then so many businesses insist on telling prospective clients about themselves? Why do businesses insist on a boring wall of text about themselves and their company in their online presence? Why is it that some go so far as to have it front and centre on their websites? I'll tell you why. It's because they're selfish. Just like the customers they're trying to attract, they care more about themselves and their company than anyone else. Just like you, everyone around you is thinking of themselves first and foremost. Selfishness is quality everyone possesses and if you want to effectively sell to those people then you should take advantage of it rather than limit your success because of it.

#### What nobody cares about

Nobody cares where or when your company was founded.

Nobody cares by whom your company was founded unless they're famous or very well known in some way, at which point it's used a marketing / investment lever, and certainly has utility entirely separate from the boring wall of text inflicted upon customers in the predominant, non-famous case.

Nobody cares how many offices you have or where they are, unless of course you're running bricks and mortar shop fronts.

Nobody cares who your customers are or how much those customers are worth.

Nobody cares how much your company has grown.

Nobody enduring a sales and/or technical meeting with you cares about you or your company or the history of either. Your customer is selfish and only cares about solving their own problem, so respect their time and don't selfishly waste it by talking about yourself and your company. **They do not care about you or your company**. Stop it.


Technology, ugh. Nobody cares about your technological skills or indeed the hidden technology that drives or enables your product. No one cares!


Double demerit points: Nobody cares about your previous companies!

Nobody cares about where you went to school (university, whatever), the marks you received or when you graduated (or left whatever institution, whatever). Heck, we don't even want to know if you're self taught. Please just solve our problems. 

Nobody cares about the types of systems you've built in the past.

Nobody cares about your development philosophy or your advocacy for whatever system, plaform, architecture or language you have a bias for. 

Nobody cares what your hobbies are.

Nobody cares about your philanthropy, volunteer or charity work (as honourable and praiseworthy it may well be).

Nobody cares about your partnerships.

#### What everybody cares about



They want to know how your product or service is going to help them grow revenue, shorten production, or improve time to delivery.  Pull out your pitch deck or presentation and take a look at the first few pages,

I got 10 bucks it's all about you and your company.  Therefore, it's pitch deck -- pitch it!

Your prospects or customers want value. Know what you can do to make the life of your customers better and start there. That's why they agree to meet you!








#### Company brand




#### Personal brand vs product brand
whether it's a service, company or product, it is your product brand, not your personal brand.

for personal brand, people want a story, not a wall of yawn inducing trivial minutiae devoid of colour, character or theme.
