Whether you're selling information or software products, or tech consulting services, the only thing that matters to your customers is the fact that you can fix <i>their</i> problem. Your customers are selfish. They only care about themselves. 
</p>
<p>
Why is it then so many businesses insist on telling prospective clients about themselves? Why do businesses confront customers with a boring wall of text about themselves and their company in their online presence? Why is it that some go so far as to have it front and centre on their websites? I'll tell you why. It's because they're selfish. Just like the customers they're trying to attract, they care more about themselves and their company than anyone else. Just like you, everyone around you is thinking of themselves first and foremost. Selfishness is quality everyone possesses and if you want to effectively sell to those people then you should take advantage of it rather than limit your success because of it.

#### What nobody cares about

When your company was founded. Do you know and/or care when Amazon or Ebay were founded? No. 

By whom your company was founded unless they're famous or very well known in some way, at which point it's used a marketing / investment lever, and certainly has utility entirely separate from the boring wall of text inflicted upon customers in the predominant, non-famous case. Do you know and/or care who founded Symantec or whatever other corporate anti-virus solution you use? No.

How many offices you have or where they are, unless of course you're running bricks and mortar shop fronts. Do you know how many offices Adobe have or where they're located? No.

Who your customers are or how much those customers are worth. Do you care how successful the top companies that use PayPal are? No.

How much your company has grown in the last 5 years or by how much you project it to grow in the next 5.

Nobody enduring a sales and/or technical meeting with you cares about you or your company or the history of either. Your customer is selfish, short of time, and only cares about solving their own problem, so respect their time and don't selfishly waste it by talking about yourself and your company. **They do not care about you or your company**. Stop it.

Technology, ugh. Nobody cares about your technological skills or indeed the hidden technology that drives or enables your product. Unless that or those particular fact or facts makes or breaks your product for your customer, they will not care!

The meaningless names of, or types of systems you've built in the past.

Your previous companies or partnerships. Double yawn!

Your development philosophy or your advocacy for whatever system, plaform, architecture or language you have a bias for. 

Your hobbies.

Your philanthropy, volunteer or charity work (as honourable and praiseworthy it may well be).

Where you went to school (university, whatever), the marks you received or when you graduated (or left whatever institution or whatever, ad infinitum). Hell, no one even wants to know if you're self taught. Please just shut up and tell us how you're going to solve our problems. 













#### What everybody cares about
Getting their problems fixed and sorted. 
Streamlining and automating processes for efficiency gains and reduced costs.
Higher product/service turnover.
Greater customer satisfaction.
Larger profits.
More meaningful business, market and customer intelligence. 




Your prospects or customers want value. Know what you can do to make the life of your customers better and start there. That's why they agree to meet you!

self-absorbed





#### Company brand




#### Personal brand vs product brand
whether it's a service, company or product, it is your product brand, not your personal brand.

for personal brand, people want a story, not a wall of yawn inducing trivial minutiae devoid of colour, character or theme.
