Whether you're selling physical goods, information or software products, or consulting services, the only thing that matters to your customers is the fact that you can fix <i>their</i> problem. Your customers are selfish. They only care about themselves. 
</p>
<p>
Why is it then so many businesses with an online presence insist on a boring wall of text about themselves and their company? Why is it that some go so far as to have it front and centre on their websites? I'll tell you why. It's because they're selfish. Just like the customers they're trying to attract, they care more about themselves and their company than anyone else. Just like you, everyone around you is thinking of themselves first and foremost. Selfishness is quality everyone possesses and if you want to effectively sell to those people then you should take advantage of it rather than inhibit your success because of it.

<b>They do not care about you or your company</b>.


##### personal brand vs product brand
whether it's a service, company or product, it is your product brand, not your personal brand.

for personal brand, people want a story, not a wall of yawn inducing trivial minutiae devoid of colour, character or theme. 



Rule number one in sales, no one cares about you or your company:
No one cares how long your company has been in business or who your customers are.
No one cares where you're headquartered or how many offices there are.
No one cares how long you've been on the INC 500 or how much your company has grown in the past 5 years. 
No one gives a shit about you or your company. 
When a prospect calls you or even more importantly when you call a prospect and they agree to give you a meeting, the last thing they want to hear about is you and your company.  When they agree to meet, a contract has been created. In consideration for their time they expect to learn something that can help them solve their problem, not hear about your company. 

Your prospects are stupid busy, they didn't agree to meet so you could bore them with trivial, impertinent, self-absorbed information.  In exchange for their time, your customers or prospects want insight. They want to learn something.  They want to know how your product or service is going to help them grow revenue, shorten production, or improve time to delivery.  Pull out your pitch deck or presentation and take a look at the first few pages,

I got 10 bucks it's all about you and your company.  Therefore, it's pitch deck -- pitch it!

Your prospects or customers want value. Know what you can do to make the life of your customers better and start there. That's why they agree to meet you!
