    I don't know how many times I've read or heard this question over the years but if I had a dollar for every one of those times, I'd be a rich man! In the past I might've answered this question with <i>"If you have to ask, then the answer is probably 'No'"</i> but I've thought a bit about this question lately and have come to the conclusion that the process, mechanics and practice of programming aren't necessarily well understood before one decides to follow a software engineering career path.

    I'm not claiming that the indicators I outline in this article are definitive, however personal experience and having worked with many, many different people over the years lead me to believe that there are many common traits that indicate certain people would be quite capable of becoming software enngineers and enjoy doing so.

#### Building


#### Making
If you like making things or fixing things around the house just because it seems like a fun, cost saving, or interesting exercise, even when you know that that your final product may not be as good as a bought one then programming may be for you. If you just "have a go" at making something even though you there's a good possibility of failing, wasting your time and you'll end up having to buy "the real thing" then programming may be for you.


#### Breaking
If you like pulling things apart just to see how they tick, then programming may be for you. 


#### Appreciation and Wonder
If you have an appreciation of machinery, mechanics, electronics and/or technology whether that be from actual hands on hacking, modifying repairing, fixing, etc. or from a viewpoint of wonder and intruige of how they work then programming may be for you.
