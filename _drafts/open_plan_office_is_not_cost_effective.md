Open plan work environments. Often touted as superior when compared to private work areas and offices not only because of the reduction in costs of accomodating staff, but also because of the open collaboration, communication, social interraction and team building they <i>apparently</i> foster.
</p>
<p>
But is any of this actually true? Shouldn't we be looking at empirical studies to determine whether or not the percieved benefits are grounded in truth and reality? Do the cost savings of open plan work environments really stack up? Well, I know of plenty of studies and academic papers on the matter, but I'm not willing to pay for them for the sake of this article so at best I will cite them and summarise their results. I will however try to appeal to the common sense, logical reasoning and empathy of you, the reader.
</p>
<p>
Are open plan work spaces an environment employees prefer to work in, or are they an environment which is preferable for getting work done? Both? Neither?

"Open plan". Words that make an introvert cringe and an extrovert jump for joy and then talk at someone about it for the next ten minutes. Today I won't be running the introvert vs extrovert argument (although perfectly valid) for this article. I will however debate the topic with everyone in mind and what might be best for all, including the company.

Ah, knowledge work. Software engineering, design, development, programming, whatever you want to call what we do, it all requires at least a small amount of concentration and as little cognitive distraction and annoyance as is practicable (particularly visual and aural). Great. Oh yeah, a bit of respect for the mental difficulty and professionalism of our trade wouldn't go astray either. 


#### The Argument for Open Plan Work Spaces
I'll just quote from an absurd article titled: [Productivity Hacks: The Open Plan Office][2] to get this ball of mud rolling. Also: don't you love the cute, hip marketing speak? "Productivity Hacks"... I've noted that one in my diary for the next corporate dinner I'm invited to. Should definitely turn some heads!

_"I have always insisted on having an open plan office. It makes things so much easier when you can simply get up and walk over to a colleague if you need to discuss something. Ideas flow a lot more freely..."_

( **and obliterate the state machine he/she has been carefully crafting in their head over the last 10 minutes of intense concentration absolutely smashing the stack** )
( **Hey, I just sent you an email...** )

[agile for the introvert][3]

[3]:http://blog.founddrama.net/2012/08/agile-for-the-introvert/comment-page-1/



_First, the bad uncomfortable news: Sometimes there is absolutely no substitute for a good ol’ fashioned Agile bullpen. You’ll be better off if you accept this now. While (as an introvert) this is usually the last thing on Earth that I want to do, there are situations that demand it. If you’re up against an important deadline delivery, then you know that you need all the communication bandwidth you can get. Sometimes it’s easier to just have everyone in a room, stand up, shout out the latest critical changes, kick off the integration build, and move on to the next thing. (Where I come from, we call this “Thunderdoming.”)_ "Thunderdoming"... another entry for my corporate dinner diary. Thanks!

Oh the joyful imagary this creates in my mind. I've always wanted to do intricate work in the middle of an old fashioned stock exchange with people _"shouting out the latest critical changes"_. Critical changes requiring concentration and some level of intelligence and thought in a roudy stock exchange type arena. I guess the philosophy naturally extends to having physicists trying to crack out some string theory equations or multi-polarization of qubits proofs all packed into an open area with random people standing up and shouting random terms and numbers. I suppose brain surgeons, watch makers, and all manner of other knowledge workers would all benefit from this arrangement too. Awesome.

<i>Pair programming is a bit of a pipe dream for most organizations, but if you have gregarious developers who talk to one another, they will at least understand what is going on in each other’s development trees. That means, also, working in group settings. It doesn’t have to be in the office all the time. Some deep code changes require getting away from all distractions for a bit, but if the results of that deep dive don’t come to light in the group, the knowledge only lives in the mind of the hermit and doesn’t ever benefit the organization as a whole.</i>
</p>
<p>
I don't write code, no. I just change it sometimes, and sometimes I even get to make <i>"deep code changes"</i>. Of course, as a developer I go deep so very rarely that we should call this a _"deep dive"_ to reflect it's rarety and in order to not be classified a hermit, we must broadcast to "the group" what we did on our little self indulgent sabbatical. The other 99% of the time we should work in the group.
</p>
<p>
Having been so thoroughly enlightened by this article, I'm at a loss to know where the concept of "code monkey" and "interchangable cog" come from. "Where's Bob?" "Oh, he needs some quiet time now. He's changing some code".

#### The data
**Distraction**



<br/>
<br/>

** **
I know some kick arse developers who can hammer out robust, coherent and understandable code when afforded a little peace, yet these same people fail to function at a third of their ability in the maelstrom of movement and cacophany of yakking about kids and weekend activities that we sadly call an office these days. Yes, open plan. In what other alternate universe would it be acceptible to prevent the intricate knowledge work of a professional taking place in order to promote "collaboration" and "team work"?





Noise and consequence

The funny part about the extrovert workplace or culture is that there really isn't any proof that it works. The merits of collaboration are asserted, not proven. I would say that we end up with offices that extroverts like to work in, not necessarily offices that get work done. Remember those Harvard Business School extroverts? They are probably the ones who end up being the managers who decide how the office should look and push for socially intensive "collaboration". But these choices hurt everyone's work performance, not just introverts'. For example, Cain points out that brainstorming doesn't work: studies show people generate better ideas individually.

For software development, Cain cites Tom DeMarco's work, also documented in his classic book Peopleware. DeMarco ran the Coding War Games, a study testing programming performance of over 600 programmers from 92 companies. The best outperformed the worst by 10 to 1. Folks, this is the origin of the "good programmers are 10 times more productive" axiom. There was no correlation between performance and experience, time nor salary. What is significant is that programmers from the same companies performed at the same level, even though they did not work together! The key piece of data is that top performers worked for companies that gave them the most privacy, personal space and a distraction-free environment. Another study tells us that office noise reduces knowledge worker productivity by 66%. Yikes.

Proponents of collaboration may have been inspired by open source projects on the Internet (Linux, for example) as examples of successful collaboration. But Cain points out that there is a significant difference with online collaboration: developers are physically isolated. They work alone, and only interact when they want to. The tools of collaboration -- email, mailing lists/forums and bug tracking software -- are asynchronous and undisruptive. This works great for introverts.

Cain names numerous famous introverts (e.g., Newton, Einstein, Chopin, Spielberg, Ghandi, Wozniak) and describes many strengths associated with introversion. A third to half of all people are introverts. The bottom line is that it makes no business sense to alienate a substantial part of the world with so much to contribute. Ideally, the physical workspace should allow options so introverts and extroverts can pick an environment suited to their temperament. She also wrote of "restorative niches", opportunities for solitude so introverts can recharge. I am fortunate to be allowed to work from home a couple of days a week. Most importantly, in my opinion, we need to appreciate the differences in our temperaments and accommodate them so both introverts and extroverts feel welcome in the modern workplace. 

With a lack of privacy comes noise—the talking, typing, and even chewing of one’s co-workers. A 1998 study found that background noise, whether or not it included speech, impaired both memory and the ability to do mental arithmetic [4],

<br/>
<br/>

**sub topic Music is as distracting as noise: the differential distraction of background music and noise on the cognitive test performance of introverts and extraverts**
yep, so what to do? Many people retreat into a pair of headphones and listen to music to try to block out all other auditory distractions. Unfortunately, studies show this is detrimental to cognitive performance too. 

while another study found that even music hindered performance [5].
[5] Furnham and Strbac, “Music Is as Distracting as Noise” (Ergonomics, 2002)
<br/>
<br/>

**Privacy**
In 1980, a group of psychology researchers published a study suggesting that this sacrifice might have unintended consequences. They found that “architectural privacy” (the ability to close one’s door, say) went hand in hand with a sense of “psychological privacy” (feeling “control over access to oneself or one’s group”). And a healthy dose of psychological privacy correlated with greater job satisfaction and performance [3].

**Productivity**
exhausting and unproductive
<br/>
<br/>

**knowledge work and innovation**
Solitude Matters

Transcendent power of Solitude

generate ideas free from the distortions of group dynamics

the more freedom you give to introverts to be themselves, the better the solutions they like do
1. stop the madness for constant group work... need much more privacy, much more freedom and much more autonomy at work
<br/>
<br/>

**introverts vs extroverts**
yeah, yeah, i said I wouldnt do it.

heavy emphasis on collaboration, open plan offices, people packed together into team rooms, constant verbal interaction such as all-day pair programming, lack of privacy, and of course noise. The workplace is now a high-stimulation environment

Introvert, extrovert

Cain's definition of introversion and extroversion is pretty much what you would expect if you are familiar with Myers-Briggs. She emphasizes that "introvert" does not mean shy nor anti-social. Rather, an introvert tends to focus on the inner world of thought and feeling, enjoys solitude, dislike conflict and focus well. An extrovert would be the opposite, focusing on the exterior world and social interaction, are comfortable with conflict and enjoy multitasking. Another way to look at this is to say that introverts are more sensitive to outside stimulation, such as noise or people, and thrive at lower levels of such stimulation. Conversely, an extrovert needs a greater intensity of stimulation to feel "right". An introvert needs solitude to recharge after experiencing elevated levels of stimulation. An extrovert is the opposite: he recharges with social interaction.

The difference between introverts and extroverts -- keep in mind this is a continuum rather than a binary distinction -- in terms of optimal stimulation levels helps explain work environment preferences. An introvert works best in a relatively quiet, distraction-free environment, such as a private office. An extrovert is energized by the constant social interaction of pair programming and the bustling activity of an open plan office.

There have always been introverts and extroverts, so why does the work environment tend to favor the latter? It's not just the cost-savings from packing more people into less space. Cain points out that there has been a change of culture in the US. (I am writing specifically of US culture because not all cultures have the same antipathy towards introversion).
