## Background noise, talking, stuff, etc.

yep, so what to do? Many people retreat into a pair of headphones and listen to music to try to block out all other auditory distractions. Unfortunately, studies show this is detrimental to cognitive performance too.

## Music is as distracting as noise: the differential distraction of background music and noise on the cognitive test performance of introverts and extraverts


I know some kick arse developers who can hammer out robust, coherent and understandable code when afforded a little peace, yet these same people fail to function in the maelstrom of ... and cacophany ... that we call an office these days. Yes, open plan. In what other alternate universe would it be acceptible to prevent the intricate knowledge work of a professional taking place in order to promote "collaboration" and "team work"? exhausting and unproductive

Picasso:
"Without great solitude, no serious work is possible," Picasso said.

Second, is that even what we want? I know people who work like that. They like to work on their own, away from distractions, and really don’t like having to interact with other people. These developers are great at working on solo projects and doing remote work. Some amazing code gets written this way and it was the way I spent most of my consulting career working. One can be “successful” in working this way.

That is one definition of success, but I’m not sure it is a definition of success that most medium to large businesses would agree with. Successful programming, from the business’ perspective, results in code that is robust, maintainable, and understood by enough staff members that if the programmer in question gets sick, goes on vacation, or gets hit by a bus, development doesn’t come to a screeching halt.

How do we achieve success in the business context of programming? Agile is a good start. Small changes are good. Pair programming is a bit of a pipe dream for most organizations, but if you have gregarious developers who talk to one another, they will at least understand what is going on in each other’s development trees. That means, also, working in group settings. It doesn’t have to be in the office all the time. Some deep code changes require getting away from all distractions for a bit, but if the results of that deep dive don’t come to light in the group, the knowledge only lives in the mind of the hermit and doesn’t ever benefit the organization as a whole.

We need to promote a new image for today’s programmer; especially when it comes to slashing generalizations about gender or personality. We should celebrate the collaborative aspects of the job.

I have grumbled before about the trend away from private offices towards cubicles and open plan offices. At the same time, there are people who genuinely prefer these offices, which I considered inhumane. Then I read a book: "Quiet: the power of introverts in a world that can't stop talking", by Susan Cain. It helped clarify the differences between introverts and extroverts, the rise of the latter, and the implications all this has on workplace productivity.

Introvert, extrovert

Cain's definition of introversion and extroversion is pretty much what you would expect if you are familiar with Myers-Briggs. She emphasizes that "introvert" does not mean shy nor anti-social. Rather, an introvert tends to focus on the inner world of thought and feeling, enjoys solitude, dislike conflict and focus well. An extrovert would be the opposite, focusing on the exterior world and social interaction, are comfortable with conflict and enjoy multitasking. Another way to look at this is to say that introverts are more sensitive to outside stimulation, such as noise or people, and thrive at lower levels of such stimulation. Conversely, an extrovert needs a greater intensity of stimulation to feel "right". An introvert needs solitude to recharge after experiencing elevated levels of stimulation. An extrovert is the opposite: he recharges with social interaction.

The difference between introverts and extroverts -- keep in mind this is a continuum rather than a binary distinction -- in terms of optimal stimulation levels helps explain work environment preferences. An introvert works best in a relatively quiet, distraction-free environment, such as a private office. An extrovert is energized by the constant social interaction of pair programming and the bustling activity of an open plan office.

There have always been introverts and extroverts, so why does the work environment tend to favor the latter? It's not just the cost-savings from packing more people into less space. Cain points out that there has been a change of culture in the US. (I am writing specifically of US culture because not all cultures have the same antipathy towards introversion).

Extroverts triumphant

Some time around the beginning of the 20th century, Cain claims, the Culture of Personality replaced the Culture of Character in the US. Outward charm replaced inner virtue. From Dale Carnegie to Tony Robbins, we are now exhorted to express ourselves, to perform, to sell ourselves. "We actually have schools for 'self-expression' and 'self-development', although we seem usually to mean the expression and development of the personality of a successful real estate agent", observed one Harold Stearns in 1921. Movie starts became our role models. Parents of introverted children fretted and tried to push a more gregarious personality.

When Cain went to Harvard Business School -- the training grounds of countless business leaders -- to do her research, she was told "Good luck finding an introvert around here". Students are pushed to be extroverts: mandatory study groups, grades heavily dependent on class participation, late night group outings … "socializing here is an extreme sport". Even before college, many elementary schools now arrange their desks in clusters or "pods" for group or cooperative learning activities. This emphasis on team and verbal skills reflects a wish to prepare kids for work in the business world.

This culture has washed over the business world and into every nook of the workplace. Software development for a long time attracted introverts due to the nature of the work. But even here, the extrovert ideal is taking over. You probably know the manifestations: heavy emphasis on collaboration, open plan offices, people packed together into team rooms, constant verbal interaction such as all-day pair programming, lack of privacy, and of course noise. The workplace is now a high-stimulation environment and seems suited for extroverts. So at least some people will thrive in there, right?

Noise and consequence

The funny part about the extrovert workplace or culture is that there really isn't any proof that it works. The merits of collaboration are asserted, not proven. I would say that we end up with offices that extroverts like to work in, not necessarily offices that get work done. Remember those Harvard Business School extroverts? They are probably the ones who end up being the managers who decide how the office should look and push for socially intensive "collaboration". But these choices hurt everyone's work performance, not just introverts'. For example, Cain points out that brainstorming doesn't work: studies show people generate better ideas individually.

For software development, Cain cites Tom DeMarco's work, also documented in his classic book Peopleware. DeMarco ran the Coding War Games, a study testing programming performance of over 600 programmers from 92 companies. The best outperformed the worst by 10 to 1. Folks, this is the origin of the "good programmers are 10 times more productive" axiom. There was no correlation between performance and experience, time nor salary. What is significant is that programmers from the same companies performed at the same level, even though they did not work together! The key piece of data is that top performers worked for companies that gave them the most privacy, personal space and a distraction-free environment. Another study tells us that office noise reduces knowledge worker productivity by 66%. Yikes.

Proponents of collaboration may have been inspired by open source projects on the Internet (Linux, for example) as examples of successful collaboration. But Cain points out that there is a significant difference with online collaboration: developers are physically isolated. They work alone, and only interact when they want to. The tools of collaboration -- email, mailing lists/forums and bug tracking software -- are asynchronous and undisruptive. This works great for introverts.

Cain names numerous famous introverts (e.g., Newton, Einstein, Chopin, Spielberg, Ghandi, Wozniak) and describes many strengths associated with introversion. A third to half of all people are introverts. The bottom line is that it makes no business sense to alienate a substantial part of the world with so much to contribute. Ideally, the physical workspace should allow options so introverts and extroverts can pick an environment suited to their temperament. She also wrote of "restorative niches", opportunities for solitude so introverts can recharge. I am fortunate to be allowed to work from home a couple of days a week. Most importantly, in my opinion, we need to appreciate the differences in our temperaments and accommodate them so both introverts and extroverts feel welcome in the modern workplace.

In 1980, a group of psychology researchers published a study suggesting that this sacrifice might have unintended consequences. They found that “architectural privacy” (the ability to close one’s door, say) went hand in hand with a sense of “psychological privacy” (feeling “control over access to oneself or one’s group”). And a healthy dose of psychological privacy correlated with greater job satisfaction and performance [3].

With a lack of privacy comes noise—the talking, typing, and even chewing of one’s co-workers. A 1998 study found that background noise, whether or not it included speech, impaired both memory and the ability to do mental arithmetic [4], while another study found that even music hindered performance [5]. There’s also the question of lighting. Open offices tend to cluster cubicles away from windows, and a forthcoming study shows that on workdays, employees without windows get an average of 47 fewer minutes of sleep than those with windows, and have worse sleep quality overall [6]. 




So what’s a research-minded boss to do? Easy: Give employees their own private offices, with plenty of sun, and turn off the overhead lights. Supply the introverts with noise-canceling headphones and decaf, but pump the extroverts full of caffeine and even let them listen to music now and then. And don’t let any of us sit too much—or stand too much. Maybe we can crouch.
