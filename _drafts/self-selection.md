    Selection criteria. A buzzword shopping list of essential and desirable technologies, frameworks, languages, and more. Sometimes you have to wonder just how many people actually have this seemingly unique combination of buzzwords, or has the requisite number of years experience. Sometimes, the techbologies listed are so obscure that you wonder how <i>anybody</i> could possibly qualify. 7 to 10 years Powerbuilder experience, 5 years Java experience, extensive experience in .NET, SunOS and Altiris? Nowhere would this be a likely skillset, but in your average city? Give me a lottery ticket!

Interesting ... since companies only hire for skills (right or wrong). So the advice is basically "stagnate in the buzzword category until you want a new job and the scramble to get experience in whatever buzzword is in the job description"



If hiring for skills then my article stands. If hiring for buzzwords then I guess /u/IAmASocketMan is correct. Would you want to work somewhere that disregards your fundamental skills in order to tick off their buzzword list? Perhaps. That isn't the point of the article. As a side note, I've never been an unemployed developer and have been doing this stuff for a very long time. YMMV however...



Let me clarify, in my context "skills" was buzzwords, I should have used buzzwords first.
Most job descriptions are looking for a candidate who knows XYZ library (like RoR or AngularJS, etc, whatever). Like it or not most companies have little interest in training someone and the expectation is that developers learn on their own time.
Perhaps I've interviewed at the wrong places but I've met very few would hire solely based on proficiency of the skills you list as "to learn," rather they would hire for immediate impact in whatever framework/library/API they needed.



I would encourage anyone to address criteria asking for a particular buzzword in a job description with how their skills fill the need that that criteria is specifying. e.g. if the criteria states "n years experience with MS SQL", I would address the criteria by explaining my experience in SQL and the number of RDBMS I have coded with and/or administered over the years. Then give an example of where this skill was used in a project and the technicalities and achievements related to it.
If you don't have experience with a particular buzzword, then do as above, then clarify that you do have the fundamental knowledge to get up to speed quickly and your underlying skills are transferable from buzzword x to buzzword y. Addressing the criteria in this way is compelling. There is no unwritten rule that says selection criteria must be addressed in the affirmative.
