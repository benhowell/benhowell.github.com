  <p>
  Humility is the single character trait above all others, that will ensure you evolve as a programmer/developer/engineer/title du jour. It is this single trait that separates the also-rans, the lifers and the dunning-krugers from the evolving, continuously learning, craft honing programmer you should be.

  <p>
  Master craftsmanship is rarely ever reached by even the most seasoned programmer. In fact, I would argue that "expert", should be considered a moving target that, even though we do our best to chase it down, stays elusive and just out of our reach.

A cathartic and essential exercise for any 

revisit old code. see how bad it is, wonder why you didn't use a more appropriate pattern, not understand why you use such strange data structures, wonder why it is so clunky, non functional, etc.

studying different langs along the way will make you see things in a different light


When I started at Amazon, I could recite for you all the incantations, psalms, voodoo chants and so on that I'd learned, all in lieu of intelligence or experience, the ones that told me Multiple Inheritance is Evil 'cuz Everyone Says So, and Operator Overloading Is Evil, and so on. I even vaguely sort of knew why, but not really. Since then I've come to realize that it's not MI that sucks, it's developers who suck. I sucked, and I still do, although hopefully less every year.

Bad developers, who constitute the majority of all developers worldwide, can write bad code in any language you throw at them.

That said, though, MI is no picnic; mixins seem to be a better solution, but nobody has solved the problem perfectly yet. But I'll still take Java over C++, even without MI, because I know that no matter how good my intentions are, I will at some point be surrounded by people who don't know how to code, and they will do far less damage with Java than with C++.

Besides, there's way more to Java than the core language. And even the language is evolving, albeit glacially, so there's hope. It's what we should be using at Amazon.

You just have to be careful, because as with any other language, you can easily find people who know a lot about the language environment, and very little about taste, computing, or anything else that's important.

When in doubt, hire Java programmers who are polyglots, who detest large spongy frameworks like J2EE and EJB, and who use Emacs. All good rules of thumb.




Be a life long student. Be humble. Invite critisism.
