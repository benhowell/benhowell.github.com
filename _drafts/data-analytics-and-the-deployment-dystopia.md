    Data analytics, at least in the "big data" sense, were once the realm of Business Intelligence, marketing and speculative trading on the stock market but things are rapidly changing. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Recruitment firms and some large employers are already using big data to qualify prospective candidates, and, with the endless march of information technology, the trend is set to trickle down to all levels of employment in the future. 
    </p>
    <p>
    We will see an exponential growth in collection and use of our personal data and erosion of privacy in our lifetimes. Inevitably ones entire life (or lack thereof) will replace their CV and unless and in order to control that CV, one will have to retain a mindfulness of the digital consequences of their actions at all times.

#### People Analytics

SCOUT Recruitment Software global business leader Andrea Tjoeng said the process, known as people analytics, could be mainstream in Australia within five years.



In [a recent article in the Herald Sun][1] SCOUT Recruitment Software global business leader Andrea Tjoeng said:

“It will be less about perfecting a CV and more about the footprint left behind in cyberspace,” she said.

“If you’re reviewing something on Whirlpool, think how that might be read by a prospective employer.

“When you are sharing anything about yourself, think whether you would share that information on your first day or in a job interview.”

Ok, well we sort of expect that employers will do a little digging online, however, the automated data analytics version is much more sinister:

The most common form of people analytics creates a profile of the company’s best employees based on staff surveys then applies the profile to new candidates during the application process to find people who are similar.

“They might look for patterns like having lots of experience in a certain role, or living within a 10km radius of the office, or (whether) that kind of person tends to enjoy researching and doing their own self-guided learning on the weekend,” Ms Tjoeng said.




“(People analytics determines) what makes up successful people, what patterns we can find and how we can use that to find similar people in the future.”
There are predicted to be both positive and negative social effects of reducing jobseekers down to a number from an algorithm.
Ms Tjoeng said the process had led to a lack of employee diversity in Silicon Valley.

“Big data showed previous experience had no bearing on whether an employee was going to succeed at xerox. It was more about cultural fit and how close they live to the office,” Ms Tjoeng said.

Big data can include keywords in resumes and answers on company questionnaires but increasingly, digital footprints also contribute.
Ms Tjoeng said a lot of the data collected for employee profiles might not be in our control.
“Assume any information you are sharing online, even if it is not public now, in a few years it will be,” she said.
“This is a natural evolution as our technology improves and we become more comfortable sharing our lives online.”


Hays director Darren Buchanan said big data and people analytics could also identify triggers for employees leaving their company, such as time served or reaching a certain level.
“It can be used as a flag to take some action, change behaviour or put in support structures to help people get through that period or help them take the next step forward to where they want to go,” he says.
Mr Buchanan said big data should not be used in isolation but as an extra tool to build a bigger picture.
“Like psychometric testing … (people analytics) is a component of the recruitment process rather than the be all and end all of it,” he said.
“It will never replace personal interactions.”



Analysis of big data produces correlates, probabilities and relationships between data points, uncovers trends, etc.

#### Privacy and Anonymity
In a world where people avail themselves of internet connected appliances and otherwise live their lives online, consumer convenience often takes precedence over personal privacy. Credit card purchases, store cards, frequent flyer points, your online movements tracked by ISP's (and in some countries, Australia for example, data retention is compulsory by law) and google (not to mention all the data google collects on you), all the data you give away with each application on your phone, social media accounts, shopping accounts on umpteen different sites, paypal history, ebay, the list.never.ends. Movements tracked by your mobile phone GPS, public transport e-ticket usage, tollway e-tags, eftpos usage, CCTV equiped with facial recognition. Internet of Things (IoT) will inevitably leave traces of your presence and usage of every electronic device particularly when devices are "personalised" with your own preferences (e.g. toaster: user_id: y14672, brownness=3, bread=breadbrand, type=rye, frozen=false, slice_count=2, datetime=2014-02-03T10:45:04.366) and you will probably agreed to release this information every time you cook a bit of bread because this was on the EULA that you "agreed to" when plugging the toaster in for the first time). If you think this seems far fetched, [your TV may already be spying on you and sharing your conversations with a third party][2] or your childs [Barbie doll][3] for that matter. Cradle to grave, people.


Do many people even know what data they themselves have handed over willingly? Do they know what rights they've handed over for the use of that data?

Will we have to avoid capture of practically all personal data and tracking of our movements, just like RMS? Or will that very act and the forensic evidence it does or does not leave behind be used against you by our future people analytics algorithmic overlords?

Is such personal intrusion ethically and morally defensible by anyone? Do we even have a right to privacy anymore? Will analytical profiling using the full gamut of day to day personal data of ones activities become commonplace by all and sundry? We already live in a world where automated analysis of this data is used to personally target advertising. We're very quickly approaching a world where automated "people analysis" will be used to determine employability. I can see no real end to how and where personal profiling can be used in business and law enforcement.
<br/>

#### Freedom of Information
Freedom of personal information and profiles generated and/or kept by corporate entities and government? Should one be allowed access to their own profile free of charge? Can one have their profile "removed" costs to obtain free info (court docs, FOI, scientific papers).


#### Compliance 
Compliance by law to live and express ones self in a certain way and perform certain functions as an online citizen being enforced by law is the prototypical dystopian nightmare that's great material for science fiction. I don't believe that that will be the future for us. More realistically however, I believe there may be a future where a certain uncomfortable level of compliance is subversively enforced by social pressure, due, in part, to corporate algorithms deeming your employable worth if you do not comply. If you think this seems far fetched, just read any thread on any tech forum involving the topic of employment with regard to programmers. An often parroted requirement for employment as a programmer by a range of different people and/or companies is that a prospective employee have public "side projects" (github repositories, whatever). It is already happening, albeit manually. 

So will we have to carefully craft our personal public brand at all times? Will we end up living in a world where we have to "act" as our profession at all times, both at work and at home, offline and online? Computer might say "yes".









big brother, people analytics, vanilla drone compartmental persona and life, just to be chosen by a corp/employer... otherwise unemployable.

Code for "be a good drone, do not step outside your stall, work is your life, don't have an independent thought" It's a good thing I have given up any ambition to stick my head up any bosses butt on the corporate ladder. The sad thing is I actually thought about whether to post this or not.
