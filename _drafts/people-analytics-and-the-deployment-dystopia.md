    Data analytics, at least in the "big data" sense, was once the reserve of Business Intelligence, marketing and speculative trading on the stock market but things are rapidly changing. For a lot of us, big data is about to become personal. Very personal indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
    People analytics, also referred to as workforce analytics and corporate analytics when applied to management, is the application of analytics on big data sets to create behavioural and social profiles for individual people.
    </p>
    <p>
    Recruitment firms and some large employers are already using people analytics to qualify prospective candidates and some even have dedicated workforce analytics teams to monitor and analyse the activities of their employees, as well as those of prospective employees. As with all things, the endless march of information technology is set to see this trend trickle down to all levels of employment in the future.

#### People Analytics
In [a recent article in the Herald Sun newspaper][1] SCOUT Recruitment Software global business leader Andrea Tjoeng said the process, known as people analytics, could be mainstream in Australia within five years. _"It will be less about perfecting a CV and more about the footprint left behind in cyberspace"_ Ms Tjoeng said.

OK, in this day and age, everyone expects that employers will do some digging online, however, people analytics proves to be much more sinister. In addition to profiling potential employees using external data (public, paid-for, or otherwise), some employers continually profile existing employees using both external data and via analysis of internal social media, surveys, email and the like, which is then used to define a prototypical "good employee" profile in order to employ people with similar profiles. And if an employee chooses not to use corporate social media or in-house ideation software? Well, I personally know of at least one case where quote: _"Failure to engage with [crowd-sourcing ideation software] can potentially be perceived in a negative light"_. If you're filling out questionaires at work, using the corporate social networking tools (yammer, etc.), crowd-sourcing ideation tools, email, doing surveys, etc, there may be other "unspoken" reasons beyond engaging with employees, namely, personal analysis and profiling. 

Ms Tjoeng goes on to say _"If you’re reviewing something on Whirlpool, think how that might be read by a prospective employer. When you are sharing anything about yourself, think whether you would share that information on your first day or in a job interview. They might look for patterns like having lots of experience in a certain role, or living within a 10km radius of the office, or (whether) that kind of person tends to enjoy researching and doing their own self-guided learning on the weekend"_.

But really, that's just all tip of the iceburg stuff. According to an article in [The Atlantic][6], the Las Vegas casino Harrah’s tracks the smiles of the card dealers and waitstaff on the floor (its analytics team has quantified the impact of smiling on customer satisfaction) and Bloomberg logs every keystroke of every employee along with every time they enter and leave the premises according to [Business Insider Australia][5]. The people analytics software company [Gild][7] use an algorithm that scours the internet for open-source code in order to profile software engineers, and perhaps more alarmingly, the algorithm allegedly evaluates the code for its simplicity, elegance, documentation, and several other factors, including the frequency with which it’s been adopted by other programmers. Stack Overflow is also mined to analyse questions and answers by individuals and the breadth and popularity of that advice. Linkedin and Twitter are mined to analyse the language individuals use, and have decided certain phrases and words used in association with one another distinguishes expert software engineers from less skilled programmers. According to Gild, they _"know these phrases and words are associated with good coding because it can correlate them with its evaluation of open-source code, and with the language and online behavior of programmers in good positions at prestigious companies"_. Gild also has access to data about paid projects and analyse completion times and measures of productivity for the individual[^1].

There are many other management focussed analytics companies like Gild out there and who knows what data they may be using, how their algorithms analyse that data and what "score" you end up with. Data collected about us and the profiles created from that data are not in our control. We do not know how the analysis is performed by proprietry algorithms. Should we expect our employers to be able to explain the selection process for a job or subjective performance reviews if it is influenced or determined by a complex algorithm? Is it fair and just to be reduced to a "score"? Is it OK to hire and deploy those with the highest scores and entirely bypass the interview process altogether?


because they’ve been unusually active on their professional-networking sites, or because there’s been an exodus from their corner of their company, or because their company’s stock is tanking

#### Systematic Bias
information might lead to systematic bias against whole classes of people
different neighborhoods and towns can have different racial profiles

in the exploration of this new frontier, there will be many speculations, experiments, trial, errors and it'll be everyday citizens who'll perform the role of guinea pig. There could be real-life dire consequences for those who are seen to fall outside the average, the norm.

On the other hand, many times hiring managers are just looking for a reason to discard your resume to narrow down the talent pool. Anything negative gets you tossed. They see this. Maybe it's a good sign, maybe it's a bad sign. Either way it's something out of the ordinary that will take more time to evaluate. Better just toss the resume. There's still another stack of 100 candidates to go through...


sense of identity and self worth?

#### Rights to privacy and freedom of information
Freedom of personal information and profiles generated and/or kept by corporate entities and government? Should one be allowed access to their own profile free of charge? Can one have their profile "removed" costs to obtain free info (court docs, FOI, scientific papers).

These aspects of people analytics provoke anxiety, of course. We would be wise to take legal measures to ensure, at a minimum, that companies can’t snoop where we have a reasonable expectation of privacy—and that any evaluations they might make of our professional potential aren’t based on factors that discriminate against classes of people.

Corporate analytics needs to be regulated to allow for a space for privacy and to ensure that people can consent to have their information mined.

will be tracked only for their suitability for their initial jobs, not for their potential.


Knowledge is power, if the power only flows one way then there will be control and abuse. The findings of the analytics on any potential employee (hired or not) should required to be share with that person, not only with the employer. For a modest fee (under $100) the analytics company should run that persons numbers through their system to determine the be job matches for them. Only then it can be equitable.

from anonymous marketing to personal intrusion (i.e. marketer doesn't care about the individual per-se, whereas with employers, that's all they care about).
before it was anonymous, now its personal.

#### Coincidence and Correlation over Causation 
what is the difference? why is it bad?

“(People analytics determines) what makes up successful people, what patterns we can find and how we can use that to find similar people in the future.”
Um, no.


An advantage of having knowledge about causal relationships rather than about statistical associations is that the former enables prediction of the effects of actions that perturb the observed system,” assert Joris M. Mooij, 
Analysis of big data produces correlates, uncovers trends, calculates probabilities and finds weak bonds between data points, amongst other things. What it does not provide however, is causality. Good programmers publish open source software and watch manga cartoons but is there causality anywhere in this conclusion? distinguishing cause and effect.


Correlations can easily lead one to believe something that is not true. To drive this point home with a bit of humor, a Harvard Law School student and self-proclaimed statistical provocateur named Tyler Vigen (@TylerVigen) started a site called Spurious Correlations. Vigen has shown, for example, that there is an annual correlation between the number of people who have drowned by falling into a swimming pool and the number of films in which Nicolas Cage has appeared and that the divorce rate in Maine correlates to the per capita consumption of margarine in the United States. Unilever, manufacturer of “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter!”, and other manufacturers of margarine are pretty certain they are not contributing to broken marriages in Maine. In the following 3-minute video, Vigen does a good job of explaining the difference between correlation and causation without going into any mathematics.

causal mechanism?

if there is no critical research to determine the causal mechanism that underlies correlations in data then there is no reason to believe that the result is mere coincidence.

logically and mathematically determining the difference between correlation and causation is almost impossible. Empirical evidence via repeated observation and experimentation is the only way to tell.

"""
The inter-combination of Semantic Reasoning and advanced mathematical calculations has the potential to lead to disruptive marketplace capabilities. Avoiding spurious correlations and automatically finding causal factors contained in the mountains of data now being generated each and every day is going to be a game changer in the years ahead.
"""

random chance can often find a data variable that may appear causal



http://www.letitrain.com/blog/big-data-correlation-does-not-equal-causation/
"""
Google Flu Trends, which aggregates Google searches in an attempt to accurately predict flu activity, experienced a similar conundrum. In a Science magazine article published in March of 2014, researchers from Northeastern University and Harvard reported that Google’s flu-tracking service has consistently overestimated the number of flu cases in the United States. In addition, the algorithm completely missed the swine flu epidemic.

Although the researchers assert that “there are enormous scientific possibilities in big data,” they called Google Flu Trends an example of “big data hubris,” that is described as “the often implicit assumption that big data are a substitute for, rather than a supplement to, traditional data collection and analysis.”

But, this also doesn’t mean that it is entirely coincidental or that correlation doesn’t at least suggest causation. A strong correlation gives us a reason to dig deeper, albeit with a healthy dose of skepticism. Why, because there is a natural human tendency to give in to confirmation bias (a type of selective thinking whereby one tends to notice and look for information that confirms one’s own beliefs). Avoiding this bias requires not only critical thinking, but also actively seeking both supporting and contradictory evidence. Critical thinking and the application of sound scientific methods is something our team of pricing and data scientists take very seriously before formalizing new data sources into our revenue optimization algorithms.

#### Discrimination by proxy
can you be discrimnated against, by proxy (high correlation between location and something else that leads to low score. what if the location is primarily made up of a minority race? is this correlation then a proxy for racial discrimination?

stuff about non-causality and behavioural profiles leading to discrimination (e.g. the manga thing would naturally discriminate against older workers, by proxy).

"""
Third factor C (the common-causal variable) causes both A and B
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_relationship
All these examples deal with a lurking variable, which is simply a hidden third variable that affects both causes of the correlation; for example, the fact that it is summer in Example 3. A difficulty often also arises where the third factor, though fundamentally different from A and B, is so closely related to A and/or B as to be confused with them or very difficult to scientifically disentangle from them (see Example 4).

Example 1
    Sleeping with one's shoes on is strongly correlated with waking up with a headache.
    Therefore, sleeping with one's shoes on causes headache.

The above example commits the correlation-implies-causation fallacy, as it prematurely concludes that sleeping with one's shoes on causes headache. A more plausible explanation is that both are caused by a third factor, in this case going to bed drunk, which thereby gives rise to a correlation. So the conclusion is false.

Example 2
    Young children who sleep with the light on are much more likely to develop myopia in later life.
    Therefore, sleeping with the light on causes myopia.

This is a scientific example that resulted from a study at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. Published in the May 13, 1999 issue of Nature,[5] the study received much coverage at the time in the popular press.[6] However, a later study at Ohio State University did not find that infants sleeping with the light on caused the development of myopia. It did find a strong link between parental myopia and the development of child myopia, also noting that myopic parents were more likely to leave a light on in their children's bedroom.[7][8][9][10] In this case, the cause of both conditions is parental myopia, and the above-stated conclusion is false.


Example 3
    As ice cream sales increase, the rate of drowning deaths increases sharply.
    Therefore, ice cream consumption causes drowning.

The aforementioned example fails to recognize the importance of time and temperature in relationship to ice cream sales. Ice cream is sold during the hot summer months at a much greater rate than during colder times, and it is during these hot summer months that people are more likely to engage in activities involving water, such as swimming. The increased drowning deaths are simply caused by more exposure to water-based activities, not ice cream. The stated conclusion is false.


Example 4

    A hypothetical study shows a relationship between test anxiety scores and shyness scores, with a statistical r value (strength of correlation) of +.59.[11]
    Therefore, it may be simply concluded that shyness, in some part, causally influences test anxiety.

However, as encountered in many psychological studies, another variable, a "self-consciousness score", is discovered that has a sharper correlation (+.73) with shyness. This suggests a possible "third variable" problem, however, when three such closely related measures are found, it further suggests that each may have bidirectional tendencies (see "bidirectional variable", above), being a cluster of correlated values each influencing one another to some extent. Therefore, the simple conclusion above may be false.

Example 5

    Since the 1950s, both the atmospheric CO2 level and obesity levels have increased sharply.
    Hence, atmospheric CO2 causes obesity.

Richer populations tend to eat more food and consume more energy



Example 6

    HDL ("good") cholesterol is negatively correlated with incidence of heart attack.
    Therefore, taking medication to raise HDL decreases the chance of having a heart attack.

Further research[12] has called this conclusion into question. Instead, it may be that other underlying factors, like genes, diet and exercise, affect both HDL levels and the likelihood of having a heart attack; it is possible that medicines may affect the directly measurable factor, HDL levels, without affecting the chance of heart attack.




Much of scientific evidence is based upon a correlation of variables[18] – they are observed to occur together. Scientists are careful to point out that correlation does not necessarily mean causation. The assumption that A causes B simply because A correlates with B is often not accepted as a legitimate form of argument.

However, sometimes people commit the opposite fallacy – dismissing correlation entirely, as if it does not suggest causation at all. This would dismiss a large swath of important scientific evidence.[18] Since it may be difficult or ethically impossible to run controlled double-blind studies, correlational evidence from several different angles may be the strongest causal evidence available.[19] The combination of limited available methodologies with the dismissing correlation fallacy has on occasion been used to counter a scientific finding. For example, the tobacco industry has historically relied on a dismissal of correlational evidence to reject a link between tobacco and lung cancer.[20]

Correlation is a valuable type of scientific evidence in fields such as medicine, psychology, and sociology. But first correlations must be confirmed as real, and then every possible causative relationship must be systematically explored. In the end correlation can be used as powerful evidence for a cause-and-effect relationship between a treatment and benefit, a risk factor and a disease, or a social or economic factor and various outcomes. But it is also one of the most abused types of evidence, because it is easy and even tempting to come to premature conclusions based upon the preliminary appearance of a correlation.

Correlations are used in Bell's theorem to disprove local causality.

#### Behavioural and Social Compliance
conclusion

positive and negative social effects of reducing jobseekers down to a number from an algorithm
lack of employee diversity
far beyond resumes. digital footprints.

Email is mined, and by using [Natural Language Processing (NLP)][8] of varying sophistication, judgements are made about our behavior and social skills, and statistical correlates used to determine intelligence and probabilities of success or failure for particular tasks. 


Perhaps the most exotic development in people analytics today is the creation of algorithms to assess the potential of all workers, across all companies, all the time.


big brother, people analytics, vanilla drone compartmental persona and life, just to be chosen by a corp/employer... otherwise unemployable.

Code for "be a good drone, do not step outside your stall, work is your life, don't have an independent thought" It's a good thing I have given up any ambition to stick my head up any bosses butt on the corporate ladder. The sad thing is I actually thought about whether to post this or not.




Compliance by law to live and express ones self in a certain way and perform certain functions as an online citizen being enforced by law is the prototypical dystopian nightmare that provides great material for science fiction. I don't believe that that will be the future for us. More realistically however, I believe there may be a future where a certain uncomfortable level of compliance is subversively enforced by social pressure, due, in part, to corporate algorithms deeming your employable worth if you do not comply. If you think this seems far fetched, just read any thread on any tech forum involving the topic of employment with regard to programmers. An often parroted requirement for employment as a programmer by a range of different people and/or companies is that a prospective employee spend their free time on public "side projects" (github repositories, whatever), as if one's entire life must be spent honing their craft. What about hobbies? Well, programming of course. See profiling and compliance is already happening, albeit analysed manually.

More and more decisions that affect our lives will be made by profiling algorithms. get used to it. 

Even if we can solve the "causal mechanism problem", is this really a world we want to live in? is it ethical?

Will we have to avoid capture of practically all personal data and tracking of our movements and become a digital recluse, just like [RMS][4]? Or will that very act and the forensic evidence it does or conversely, does not leave behind be used against us by our future people analytics algorithmic overlords?

Is such personal intrusion ethically and morally defensible by anyone? Do we even have a right to privacy anymore? Will analytical profiling using the full gamut of day to day personal data of ones activities become commonplace by anyone and everyone? We already live in a world where automated analysis of this data is used to personally target advertising. We're very quickly approaching a world where automated "people analysis" will be used to determine employability. There is no end to how and where personal profiling can be used in business and law enforcement.

So will we have to carefully craft our personal public brand at all times? Will we end up living in a world where we have to "act" as our profession at all times, both at work and at home, offline and online? Computer might say "yes".
