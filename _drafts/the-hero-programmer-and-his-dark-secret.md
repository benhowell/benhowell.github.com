the hero programmer that saves the day is a reflection of bad engineering practice and procedures.

The myth of the individually brilliant hero-developer who comes in and saves the day may be an appealing one, but it is largely just that: a myth. There are far easier ways to improve results than go looking for that one superhero developer that will save your company: how about taking the leash of the developers you already have? If theyâ€™re half decent, chances are your results will sky-rocket.
