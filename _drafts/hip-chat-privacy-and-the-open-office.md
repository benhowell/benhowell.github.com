hip-chat, privacy and the open office

The Atlassian terms require binding arbitration for disputes. As HipChat grows, we need to have a cost-effective alternative to going to court.

The forced arbitration seems a bit odious... general mills just got dinged for that and had to apologize...I wonder if the same thing will happen here.  For those who don't know, forced arb basically gives them carte blanche to harm you and have the case handled by their "friends" instead of the justice system.




You also control the routers, the email server, any other form of digital communications, and possibly even the software in their desktop.
What's the difference? Just because an employer can snoop -- and might be legally obligated to snoop -- doesn't mean your company can't have a clear policy regarding when and how you will exercise that ability inherent in owning infrastructure.
