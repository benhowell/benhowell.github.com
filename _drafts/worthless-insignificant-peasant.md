**Condescension**

<span markdown="span">_An attitude of patronizing superiority; disdain._</span>
</p>
<p>
Being talked down to and having your attempted contributions dismissed as if you are filthy scum and not worthy of recognition as a human being is not a pleasant experience. When this happens to you in your professional life, you'll probably feel insulted, angry and disrespected. However, these feelings are unjustified. When this sort of situation happens, how you react to it is what matters and will not only influence the way you feel now but also into the future.
</p>
<p>
Don't react. Just step back and take a moment to analyse the situation like the logical, analytical professional you are. Treat it as a psychological game of one-upmanship.

#### It's a reflection of their character.
They have failed the [Waiter rule][1]. _"If someone is nice to you but rude to the waiter, they are not a nice person."_ -- <cite>[Dave Barry][2]</cite>. 

A person who moderates their condescension and rude manner depending on their perceived status or value of the person they're interacting with has a serious character flaw. If they treat people according to how subordinate they perceive them to be then they probably have a need to prove or otherwise refect their imagined sense of superiority, which is a classic sign of insecurity.
<br/>
<br/>



#### It's a direct indication of the amount of trust and respect they command.

A boss that talks down to you can be a real problem. Not only does it impact your personal confidence and mindset, but it can be embarrassing and detrimental to the entire workplace’s performance. 

"Sitting in the chair of CEO makes me no better of a person than the forklift operator in our plant," she says. "If you treat the waiter, or a subordinate, like garbage, guess what? Are they going to give it their all? I don't think so."

CEOs who blow up at waiters have an ego out of control, Gould says. "They're saying, 'I'm better. I'm smarter.' Those people tend not to be collaborative."

<br/>
<br/>



#### It's their problem.
They could be a psychopath, and if so, there is no redemption for this person as they have a mental disorder. Otherwise it's most likely a personality disorder.

Look, most of the time, things like this aren’t really about YOU. So instead of taking it personally, try to consider for a moment what’s going on for your boss. What’s causing this behavior? Does he perhaps feel threatened by you in some way? Does he have a self-esteem issue that causes him to put others down so he can feel better about himself? You might uncover something that makes the behavior a little easier to put up with or just ignore altogether. Sometimes people have annoying character traits that don’t serve them well, but there’s nothing you can do to change them. Just remember: It’s their issue, not yours. Take comfort in the fact that, if you see it, others see it too. And this kind of behavior will hold them back in life and in their career at some point.

#### Dealing with it

Go back and read each sub-heading in this article. Notice there's no mention of _you_? That's right, it's all about _them_. Every problem is theirs. Not only do we know this, they do too. There is nothing here for you to deal with. Full stop.

You maintain your composure because their ludicrous, display of ego is a serious character flaw and has nothing to do with you. You are the better person and your control over the situation is proof of that. You may not realise this, but anyone who witnesses such indiscretions, or is the target of them, recognises this too. Your self-worth simply cannot be in any way linked to a character flaw in someone else. It just doesn't compute.
<br/>
<br/>

#### Winning
Reacting as if been slighted is a loss. Not reacting at all is a win. Now find whatever avenues you can to cut this person out of your life. Don't deal with them again. If you do need to deal with them going forward then keep the interface to an absolute minimum. At this point, you have won. You are the superior person. Ultimately they'll realise what's happening and why, and at that point, you are the superior person in their mind too. But you don't actually care what they think any more, do you?
