**Condescension**
</span>

/ˌkɒndɪˈsɛnʃn/

<p>
<span markdown="span">_An attitude of patronizing superiority; disdain._</span>
</p>
<p>
Being talked down to and having your attempted contributions dismissed as if you are filthy scum and not worthy of recognition as a human being is not a pleasant experience. When this happens to you in your professional life, you'll probably feel insulted angry and disrespected too. Of course these feelings are justified, but when this happens, how you react to it is what matters and will not only influence the way you feel now and into the future, but also how the perpertrator feels (unless they're a psychopath).
</p>
<p>
Before you react, just step back and take a moment to analyse the situation like the logical, analytical professional you are. Treat it as an unspoken mental and psychological game of one-upmanship.

#### It's a reflection of their character.
They have failed the [Waiter rule][1]. _"If someone is nice to you but rude to the waiter, they are not a nice person."_ -- <cite>[Dave Barry][2]</cite>.


situational value system, 
status of the person they are interacting with  
Be especially wary of those who are rude to people perceived to be in subordinate roles






"To some people, speaking in a condescending manner makes them feel important, which to me is a total turnoff," 



<br/>
<br/>



#### It's a direct indication of the amount of trust and respect they command.

A boss that talks down to you can be a real problem. Not only does it impact your personal confidence and mindset, but it can be embarrassing and detrimental to the entire workplace’s performance. 

"Sitting in the chair of CEO makes me no better of a person than the forklift operator in our plant," she says. "If you treat the waiter, or a subordinate, like garbage, guess what? Are they going to give it their all? I don't think so."

CEOs who blow up at waiters have an ego out of control, Gould says. "They're saying, 'I'm better. I'm smarter.' Those people tend not to be collaborative."

#### It's their problem.
They could be a psychopath, and if so, there is no redemption for this person as they have a mental disorder.

Look, most of the time, things like this aren’t really about YOU. So instead of taking it personally, try to consider for a moment what’s going on for your boss. What’s causing this behavior? Does he perhaps feel threatened by you in some way? Does he have a self-esteem issue that causes him to put others down so he can feel better about himself? You might uncover something that makes the behavior a little easier to put up with or just ignore altogether. Sometimes people have annoying character traits that don’t serve them well, but there’s nothing you can do to change them. Just remember: It’s their issue, not yours. Take comfort in the fact that, if you see it, others see it too. And this kind of behavior will hold them back in life and in their career at some point.

#### Dealing with it

Go back and read each sub-heading in this article. Notice there's no mention of _you_? That's right, it's all about _them_. Every problem is theirs. Not only do you know this, they do too. There is nothing here for you to deal with. Full stop.

Focus on yourself and maintaining your composure, even when you feel put down. Be the bigger person. Don’t let someone else’s bad attitude ruin your day or your self-worth. Consider this practice. We all have to deal with difficult people in the workplace. You’re getting some great experience here! Remember the old saying, “Kill ‘em with kindness.” Sometimes, nothing feels better than responding to rudeness with a smile and warm-hearted compassion. And it often shifts the other person’s behavior as well.

Practice indifference and emotional detachment– learn how not to let an asshole touch your soul.  Management gurus and executives are constantly ranting about the importance of commitment, passion, and giving all you have to a job. That is good advice when your bosses and peers treat you with dignity. But if you work with people who treat you like dirt...
<br/>
<br/>


#### Winning
Reacting as if been slighted is a loss. Not reacting at all is a win. Now find whatever avenues you can to cut this person out of your life. Don't deal with them again. Ultimately they'll realise what's happening and why and at this point, you are the superior person in their mind.
