This is a follow-up post to a previous article addressing some of the comments I received. The previous article can be read here: <span markdown="span">[Should I become a Programmer?]({% post_url 2015/02/08/should-i-become-a-programmer %})</span>
  
  
    The examples on the list aren't supposed to be taken literally. They're just some examples off the top of my head. The message I'm trying to convey here is this:

If someone has an interest in machines (whether they be mechanical, biological, astronomical, whatever) then there's a chance they will also be interested in "thought machines" (i.e. machines made out of code).

If someone has an interest in construction and doing things by hand (woodwork, metalwork, building engines, etc.) then there's a chance they will also be interested in constructing "thought machines" (i.e. making their own machines in code).

If someone has an interest in how stuff works (breaking things down to see how they tick, thinking about how processes work, learning a new skill in order to better understand how something works, etc.) then there's a chance they will also be interested in how "thought machines" and information/computing processes work (i.e. deconstructing machines built by others, or deconstruction of their own ideas into constituent parts in order to build their own machines).

Thanks for the comments!


I think those lists shouldn't be taken literally. They rather describe a state of mind to have in life, one that IT people (and in some other fields) have or acquire.



Thanks for the comments fellas, I appreciate it.

The examples on the list aren't supposed to be taken literally. They're just some examples I jotted down over coffee and published. The message I'm trying to convey here is this:

Feels more like a checklist on whether to become a mechanic, it's quite a lot of "do you like to tinker with physical objects" styled questions.
