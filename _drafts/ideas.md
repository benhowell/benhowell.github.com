-----------------------------------


 * timesheeting of developers
 * "hackathons"
 * why your code is shit (paying low, short contracts, timesheets, no long term career paths, churn, lack of care, apathy, no users, no one cares.)

 * future trends in programming: looking towards the future, maths concepts and functional programming, moving into parallel programming and concurrency. Future libraries will need to be concurrent. Evolution will be Explicit -> implicit, languages like java need to bake parallelism into core libs. 



 * API design. (little manual of API design)
 
 https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/
 
 * Knuth: programming is writing. Even books and articles on complex subjects are fairly light on structure.
 
 * avx instructions in language x?
 * visitor pattern?
 * command pattern?

‘The programmer, has to be able to think in terms of conceptual hierarchies that are much deeper than a single mind ever needed to face before.’

 * reactor pattern, event loops, etc. ala twisted 
 
 * serendipity - discovering patterns and methodologies by chance (i.e. after coding them, find out later those patterns exist)
 
 * performance enhancing drugs (software engineering)
 
 
 
 * the indie web

 http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourWordsAreWasted.aspx

 is the indie web in a golden age?
 like the gold rushes, land grabs, etc of a century or two past?
 will there be little to no independent publication on a mass scale as we see today, much like what we see in mainstream print, radio and television media? 
 
 
 
 * The myth of the just world
don't be naive, be politically savvy. "the myth of the just world"

http://www.manager-tools.com/2013/05/politics-101-chapter-3-myth-just-world-part-2
 
you wont be rewarded accordingly, all success includes political calculations (personal). 
just world hypothesis.
i will be rewarded appropriately if I work hard and get ahead by doing so. cognitive dissonance.

confirmation bias.
play the game. unfair, no strict rules.
learn when to be selfish.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AI and machine learning is now just application of existing algorithms in various packages (look them up). Research institutes and academia are now content to apply existing AI/ML to domain specific problems and / or compare and contrast the applicability of such existing algorithms for publication.

where is the real AI/ML research going on?

the hero programmer that saves the day is a reflection of bad engineering practice and procedures.

The myth of the individually brilliant hero-developer who comes in and saves the day may be an appealing one, but it is largely just that: a myth. There are far easier ways to improve results than go looking for that one superhero developer that will save your company: how about taking the leash of the developers you already have? If they’re half decent, chances are your results will sky-rocket.
