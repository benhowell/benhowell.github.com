 * API design. (little manual of API design)
 
 https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/

 * Software is for humans, not computers.
 
 * Knuth: programming is writing. Even books and articles on complex subjects are fairly light on structure.
 
 * avx instructions in language x?
 * visitor pattern?
 * command pattern?

 * scala as a scripting language
 * mvc framework for scala using javafx 2
 * threading in javascript from java?

‘The programmer, has to be able to think in terms of conceptual hierarchies that are much deeper than a single mind ever needed to face before.’

 * reactor pattern, event loops, etc. ala twisted 
 
 * Scanning Classification
 The previous classifier was built for multi-classifier subscriptions which are strictly hierarchical, this classifier is useful if there are overlapping classifiers which cover various parts of the event space without forming a hierarchy. It can be compared to tuning in on (possibly multiple) radio stations by geographical reachability (for old-school radio-wave transmission).
 
 
 * serendipity - discovering patterns and methodologies by chance (i.e. after coding them, find out later those patterns exist)
 
 
 
 
 * the indie web

 is the indie web in a golden age?
 like the gold rushes, land grabs, etc of a century or two past?
 will there be little to no independent publication on a mass scale as we see today, much like what we see in mainstream print, radio and television media? 
 
 
The myth of the just world
don't be naive, be politically savvy. "the myth of the just world"

you wont be rewarded accordingly, all success includes political calculations (personal). 
just world hypothesis.
i will be rewarded appropriately if I work hard and get ahead by doing so. cognitive dissonance.

confirmation bias.
play the game. unfair, no strict rules.
learn when to be selfish.
