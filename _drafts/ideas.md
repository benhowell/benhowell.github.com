dysrationalia - intelligence vs wisdom
http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150413-the-downsides-of-being-clever?ocid=global_bbccom_email_14042015_future
"""
So if intelligence doesn’t lead to rational decisions and a better life, what does? Igor Grossmann, at the University of Waterloo in Canada, thinks we need to turn our minds to an age-old concept: “wisdom”. His approach is more scientific that it might at first sound. “The concept of wisdom has an ethereal quality to it,” he admits. “But if you look at the lay definition of wisdom, many people would agree it’s the idea of someone who can make good unbiased judgement.”

imposter syndrome? ... not really what i'm aiming at. more along the lines of "i'm getting paid a lot of money and do nothing of worth. public servant, no one around me achieves anything or makes any diference. Nothing I do has any worth or makes a difference. ROI is nothing (i make no difference to peioples lives other than cost them money). I'm a fraud, im living a lie. i work in a drop in centre, a sheltered workshop where I can come and go as I please, do what I please, spend other peoples money and get paid all the while. my skills and career have stagnated. golden handcuffs. cant leave because supporting family. no jobs. stuck. etc.

there is no glue:
gluing shit together that is impossible. use an analogy for something that a glue oes not exist (banana and concrete? etc)

rockstars, ninjas, special, our job is really really hard, we don't get respect, etc.

 * "hackathons"
 * why your code is shit (paying low, short contracts, timesheets, no long term career paths, churn, lack of care, apathy, no users, no one cares.)

 * future trends in programming: looking towards the future, maths concepts and functional programming, moving into parallel programming and concurrency. Future libraries will need to be concurrent. Evolution will be Explicit -> implicit, languages like java need to bake parallelism into core libs.

 * Knuth: programming is writing. Even books and articles on complex subjects are fairly light on structure.

‘The programmer, has to be able to think in terms of conceptual hierarchies that are much deeper than a single mind ever needed to face before.’

you wont be rewarded accordingly, all success includes political calculations (personal). 
just world hypothesis.
i will be rewarded appropriately if I work hard and get ahead by doing so. cognitive dissonance.
