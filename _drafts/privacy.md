Humankind is experiencing exponential growth in the rate of collection and use of personal data, and as a consequence, unparalleled erosion of privacy. If we, as private citizens are to get along in the big data age, we'll need to be ever mindful of the digital consequences of our actions and the detailed audit trail those actions leave behind in every aspect of our lives.


Analysis of big data produces correlates, probabilities and relationships between data points, uncovers trends, etc. 

big brother, people analytics, vanilla drone compartmental persona and life, just to be chosen by a corp/employer... otherwise unemployable.

Code for "be a good drone, do not step outside your stall, work is your life, don't have an independent thought" It's a good thing I have given up any ambition to stick my head up any bosses butt on the corporate ladder. The sad thing is I actually thought about whether to post this or not.

This is one of the dirty secrets of corporate IT, especially in the fortune 500 infrastructure space I live in.

Freedom of personal information and profiles generated and/or kept by corporate entities and government? Should one be allowed access to their own profile free of charge? Can one have their profile "removed" costs to obtain free info (court docs, FOI, scientific papers).

#### Privacy and Anonymity
Do many people even know what data they themselves have handed over willingly? Do they know what rights they've handed over for the use of that data?

In a world where people avail themselves of internet connected appliances, modern convenience, and otherwise live their lives off and online, consumer and/or corporate and government convenience often takes precedence over personal privacy. Credit card purchases, store cards, frequent flyer points, your online movements tracked by ISP's (and in some countries, Australia for example, data retention is compulsory by law) and google (not to mention all the data google collects on you), all the data you give away with each application on your phone, social media accounts, shopping accounts on umpteen different sites, paypal history, ebay, personal banking, bill paying, the.list.never.ends. Movements tracked by your mobile phone GPS, public transport e-ticket usage, tollway e-tags, eftpos usage, CCTV equiped with facial recognition. Internet of Things (IoT) will inevitably leave traces of your presence and usage of every electronic device particularly when devices are "personalised" with your own preferences (e.g. toaster: user_id: y14672, brownness=3, bread=breadbrand, type=rye, frozen=false, slice_count=2, datetime=2014-02-03T10:45:04.366) and you will probably agreed to release this information every time you cook a bit of bread because this was on the EULA that you "agreed to" when plugging the toaster in for the first time). If you think this seems far fetched, [your TV may already be spying on you and sharing your conversations with a third party][2] or your childs [Barbie doll][3] for that matter. Cradle to grave, people.

Will we have to avoid capture of practically all personal data and tracking of our movements and become a digital recluse, just like [RMS][4]? Or will that very act and the forensic evidence it does or conversely, does not leave behind be used against us by our future people analytics algorithmic overlords?

Is such personal intrusion ethically and morally defensible by anyone? Do we even have a right to privacy anymore? Will analytical profiling using the full gamut of day to day personal data of ones activities become commonplace by all and sundry? We already live in a world where automated analysis of this data is used to personally target advertising. We're very quickly approaching a world where automated "people analysis" will be used to determine employability. There is no end to how and where personal profiling can be used in business and law enforcement.

RMS says: 
I reject Facebook and Google+ because they require people to have just one account, which means that all the person's activities are grouped together. They also insist on knowing the person's usual name. I am proud to identify myself when stating my views; I can afford to do that because I am in a fairly safe position. There are people who rationally fear reprisals (from employers, gangsters, bullies, or the state) if they sign their name to their views. For their sake, let's reject any social networking site which insists on connecting an account to a person's real identity.

However, I can suggest that it may be wise to use an email service that is not connected with your search engine. That way you can be almost sure that your email contents don't influence your search results. You shouldn't identify yourself to your search engine in any case.
