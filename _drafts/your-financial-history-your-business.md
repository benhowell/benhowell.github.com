Recruitment, shady practices and unsavoury hiring advice has a habit of getting on my goat as is clear in my <span markdown="span">[rant in a previous article about recruitment]({% post_url 2014-07-17-step-away-from-the-kool-aid %})</span>. 
</p>
<p>
Hiring employees for a given position with a salary that's fair. Of course the employer will be offering market value for the person with the right skills and experience? Or will they? Will they play fair or will they disguise their slimy tactics underneath a thin veil of lies?
</p>
<p>
Is it ok to ask for an applicants personal financial history as part of the selection criteria for the job? Is it ok to reject applicants for not revealing their personal financial history? Is this even legal? I'm not sure what the answer to the last question is in whatever country you're reading this article in, but from an ethical point of view, asking applicants for financial details leaves a very bitter taste in my mouth.

salary history
http://resumellow.com/resume-tips/7-job-application-rules-from-a-guy-that-hired-300-people-in-the-last-year


some less than savoury advice for would be recruiters:

Follow instructions:
"""
I’ve developed a system that allows me to literally spend 1 second with each application and cut out over 70% of applicants.

Here’s how . . .

I place a simple instruction in the job listing and then see if applicants follow it.

The instruction is usually very simple . . . here are some examples:

Please include salary history
Please include cover letter
Please include at least three references
Please include your resume in .txt, .doc, or .pdf format
If the applicant follows the instruction, I’ll consider their resume. If they don’t, I delete them. Harsh, I know, but think about it . . . do I want to hire someone that doesn’t read and follow instructions? No. Do I want to hire people that do the job right? Yes.

If someone can’t or won’t follow instructions, they don’t belong at my company. Even with executives . . . I still want to see if they can follow simple instructions.

When an applicant follows instructions they’ve earned their way from a “glance” to a “skim.”
"""

"""
@ Steve – When I ask for salary history, I do so because I want to know what their salary history is. It helps me see what level their career is at and whether or not I can afford to hire them. If, however, they don’t include their salary history, I pass them over.
"""

"""
Save EVERYONE some time and tell people upfront the range of possible compensation for the job so you don’t get 90% of all those resumes you screen.

I hate job ads that don’t say compensation. SAVE EVERYONE THE TIME.

And salary history does NOT tell you what “level their career is at.” Most good employees don’t value salary that much. All sorts of studies prove it. The ones that do value it so highly would basically be the ones who would immediately jump ship when given a better salary.

You want more GOOD responses?:
Ask what range of salary they are looking for orand clearly state the range of compensation that you can give inthe job. You still can negotiate within that range.
"""

"""
It’s all about what they can get you for and not what you want to be paid. If you have a history of salaries in the 60-80K range, and you apply for a job that they may normally pay 110-120k, then expect to be lowballed.

Unless they ask for W-2′s from previous employers (which has never happened to me personally, but people in the sales world are sometimes expected to provide them to prove their sales record) there is really no way for them to prove it.

If someone asks, give “total compensation”, I.E. your salary plus 401(k) contribution, bonuses, value of benefits paid by the company, any educational reimbursements, etc… and let that be the starting point. If they insist on only knowing your base salary, then I would consider moving on and letting them know why you’re no longer interested.
"""

"""
Good luck finding any self-respecting person to work for your company when you demand a “salary history” up-front; I wouldn’t touch any organisation which asked for this with a ten foot pole. This article helps to confirm my belief that HR “professionals” are one of the most worthless “resources” in any organisation.
